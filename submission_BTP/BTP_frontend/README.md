## About Project
Front end application is developed utilizing React Js for web. This web application provides users with a dashboard displaying their past activities and transaction details. We provide a special web based component to interact with the comparison engine and get quick results.

On the comparison pags we provide a web based visual system to input sentences and get the results instantly. We provide features to compare using currently imputed sentences and features to load saved sentences for users which users can save for their convenience. We also provide options to download a detailed comparison report of the result found in this section itself.
